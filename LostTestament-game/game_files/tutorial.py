it, the goal in this game is to find your grandma's lost luggage, which she lost in some airport in the NEU.
You have to travel across different countries by hitchiking, sailing or flying. You can do that by using commands
{Fore.RED}hike, sail, fly{Fore.GREEN} respectively. Just add the name of the city you wish to travel to as parameter,
for example {Fore.RED}sail tallinn{Fore.GREEN}. To list all available cities you can travel to, use parameter {Fore.RED}?
{Fore.GREEN}For example, {Fore.RED}sail ?{Fore.GREEN} shows you a list of all cities you can sail to. If there is no port
in your location, that one will also tell you where is the nearest port.{Fore.RESET}"""

    text4 = f"""{Fore.GREEN}You can fly to every city you can afford to, there is no distance limit. Flying is very expensive though, so be careful!
You shouldn't spend all your money trying to find grandma's luggage, since you still have to return it back to her.
Sailing has a distance limit of {saildistance} km and hitchhiking {hikedistance} km.{Fore.RESET}"""

    text5 = f"""{Fore.GREEN}Flying costs {Fore.YELLOW}{flyprice} EP/km{Fore.GREEN} per kilometer, while sailing only {Fore.YELLOW}{sailprice} EP/km.
{Fore.GREEN}Hitchhiking is free *duh*, but it is the slowest form of travel, unless RNG-gods are with you. Sailing takes
some time, but unlike hitchhiking, its not random. Flying is instant!{Fore.RESET}"""

    text6 = f"""{Fore.GREEN}Once you get to new city, you should {Fore.RED} search{Fore.GREEN} for your grandma's luggage. Location of the luggage is
random, and there are a total of 48 cities in Lost Testament, so it might take a while. You'll use up your turn while
searching, but you can {Fore.RED}hire{Fore.GREEN} a detective to search for you. That'll cost you {hiringPrice} EP.
When you {Fore.RED}hire{Fore.GREEN} a detective you get to use your turn for travelling.

Remember:
{Fore.RED}help{Fore.GREEN} to show all commands
{Fore.RED}man command{Fore.GREEN}for manual entry of {Fore.RED}command{Fore.GREEN}
{Fore.RED}fly ?{Fore.GREEN}parameter "?" will show you a list of cities where you can travel to.
{Fore.RED}search{Fore.GREEN} to search for luggage.

Btw, command {Fore.RED} map {Fore.GREEN} shows you all the cities in Lost Testament. Be aware, that it will print a list
of 48 rows total.

It's not dangerous to go alone in Lost Testament, so I will not give you anything.
Good luck!{Fore.RESET}
