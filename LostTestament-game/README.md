##Info

his was a group project for the Software 2 course. Inside the Front_End folder, you can find the frontend part of the game that I developed. Music is also made by me.

##Installation

Execute create_game_user.sql in your own database.
NOTE: It drops the user named "game" and creates a new one in its place.

The Python code initializes the database (function format_database_for_new_game() in the file Ohjelmisto1-C/game_files/functions.py).
It drops the database named "kadonnut_testamentti" and creates a new one in its place. You probably don't have it, but I wanted to point it out.

##Note

The create_game_db.sql file must be in the same directory as the functions.py file for the database initialization function to work.
Start the program by running main.py.
